This is a simple client server implementation for testing AJAX messages.
The server is written in Python (2 not 3), and you need to install Python to run it.

You can modify the server parameters by changing the corresponding variables in the Python file
The variable names are self-explanatory. Use this to test the error-handling and timeout
functions in your AJAX requests. 

IMPORTANT: You must run the server from the /client directory or it will not work. For example,
if you're running in a Unix terminal from the command line, go to the client directory and type

python ../server/simpleserver.py

You'll see a message like "Starting Server on Port 8080" (you can change the port no.).

To connect to the server in your web browser, type "http://localhost:8080/index.html"

If you want to contribute code to the server to make it easier to configure, please do so.
