# Assignment 4

## Introduction

This assignment is a continuation ofÂ Assignment 3.

In this assignment, you will remove the hardcoded list of images from your code, and will also stop using the local image files stored on your computer. You will be using asynchronous requests (AJAX) to receive image URLs from a server, and use them to display the images in the grid.


## Tasks

1. For this task, you do not need to change the code which displays images in the grid. Add code to send a GET HTTP request to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubc-vsp24/ubc-vsp24.github.io/main/images` endpoint which returns a list of image URLs. **Print this list of URLs to the console.**
2. For this task, you will **use the list of image URLs downloaded (via AJAX) in the previous task** to display them in the grid.

## Marking
1. Task 1: 7.5 Points
2. Task 2: 7.5 Points
