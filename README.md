In the calendar, **KP** is for sessions related to Prof. Pattabiraman's course on web applications and **SG** is for sessions related to Prof. Gopalakrishnan's course on algorithms.

## Class Location

We have [MCLD 3018](https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/classrooms/mcld-3018) (MacLeod Building, Room 3018) reserved for class meetings. This is a large space so sit in the front but also allow for some distancing.
